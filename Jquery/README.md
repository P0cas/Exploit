## Reacher about Cross Site Script by Jquery 

Currently I want to have a cve. But this is very difficult because to join in a many Security researcher of all over the world. Yet I'll trying to get the cve. please i want to find one XD. 

So this time, I chose a jquery for reseach. And In Jquery version 3.5.0 or higher, no vulnerabilities have been found yet. That's why I'll try with hope.

First, before starting the research, we will analyze how well-known vulnerabilities were discovered and how jquery is configured. Good luck
